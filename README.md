# awesome-python-graphics

This repo is a collection of my leisure time implementations of various geometric patterns using Python.

Have you been wondering how🤔🤔 to simulate complex geometrical shape🔭? Maybe for some research? To understand Mathematical Functions📈? Or Perhaps for some fun😎 ?

Well, you don't need to worry about learning those complex math equations or learning to use some Game Engine like  [Unity](https://unity.com/) to get started.

Well, Python🐍 has your back for this with some neat spells. (However, later on do learn the underlying math and progress further. No real wizard wishes to decieve you from the truth)
